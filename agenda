  -- Project #2, 3, 4, 5, 6:
    -- RUN YOUR PROGRAM ON A DEPARTMENT MACHINE BEFORE YOU SUBMIT!!!
    -- Your program should run on the department systems.
       You should test for leaks on department systems.
       Valgrind does NOT work on Macs. Valgrind also is
       unreliable on VB/VM/ and perhaps WSL.
       To know if you have leaks compare your valgrind report
       with the report you get from frameGen -- using same machine!
    -- What's going on in FrameGen? What constructors/functions do I
       need or NOT need? I don't get it because Malloy speaks Greek!

    -- Some nice free fonts: link on my web page (thanks Garrett)

    -- Submit whatever we need to (re)produce your image
    -- If you "new" something you should "delete" it!
       A class should only delete data attributes that it new-ed

    -- Free fonts:
    -- Feel free to use vector2f
    -- How to add a class to the Makefile?
    -- I like to keep param lists small:
       for example, pass an SDL_Rect rather than 4 ints.

Feb 5:
  -- art vs dupe

  -- Ques: How do I know if I have a memory leak?
     Ans:  Compare with reference -- frameGen
           Which had LEAKS but I fixed them, so you
           have to do a git pull and look at the new one!

  -- Ques: How do I find my memory leak?
     Ans:  use --leak-check=full
