To install SDL2 on a Mac with the required dependences (assuming you have homebrew installed), you do:

brew install sdl2
brew install sdl2_ttf
brew install sdl2_image

I had an issue with the frame generator on Mac and producing a .bmp image (it was either corrupted or didn’t show up at all), but other than that, it’s worked fine for me.

happy coding,
