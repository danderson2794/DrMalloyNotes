The recommended VM is lubuntu, which you can find at:
https://lubuntu.net/

1. Xubuntu https://xubuntu.org/download/.  This downloads 18.04.  
You can use a BitTorrent or just download it directly using a mirror.  
The School of Computing runs Xubuntu 16 for reference. 

2. Download a Virtualization program.  Virtual box or VMware Workstation 
Player are the big ones. 
Note.  When that is set up, the directions differ slightly depending on 
which one you use, but the basic concept is the same
3.  In the virtualization program, create a new Virtual Machine.  
This will create a file that will act as another computer on top of 
your normal computer.

4.  Choose how big you want your "virtual hard disk" to be.  Also 
assign RAM size.

5.  When it asks for an os, point at the .iso file you downloaded at step 1.

6. Start the VM.  It was act as if you are doing a fresh install, 
which you are.  Choose to install the OS on the hard disk.  (The 
VM uses the virtual hard disk you made during setup).  Go through 
those settings.

7. Done.  You have a VM where you can do all things you would do on a 
normal computer.  Also, you can delete the iso you downloaded earlier 
if space is an issue.  The Ubuntu OS is now in the VM
